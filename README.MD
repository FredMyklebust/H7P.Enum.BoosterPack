### What is Enum Boosterpack?

Enum Boosterpack is a set of source generators which creates fast extension methods for your enums.
* AsString() - ToString() on enum-values is slow, AsString() is more than 17x faster on .NET 5, and more than 200x faster on .NET 4.8.
* AutoDescriptor - Creates a GetDescription() extension method that returns the value from enum-values decorated with a Description-attribute, which is more than 950x times faster on .NET 5.0, and more than 1650x faster on .NET 4.8 than using reflection.

Unlike ToString() and extracting the description-value using reflection, AsString() and GetDescription() doesn't allocate.


### Limitations

The following limitations apply:
* No support for flags yet
* Supports public and internal enums only


### How do I get started?

Enum Boosterpack will automatically identify and create AsString() extension methods for your public and internal enums. Declare an enum:

```csharp
    internal enum Color
    {
        Red,
        Green
    }   
```
Then in your application code, call AsString() instead of ToString() on your enum-value:

```csharp
var redString = Color.Red.AsString();
```

To generate GetDescription() extension methods, add a Describable-attribute to your enums. Make sure all enum-values have a Description-attribute:
```csharp
using H7P.AutoDescriptor;

    [Describable]
    internal enum Color
    {
        [Description("Red as a rose")]
        Red,

        [Description("Green as the grass")]
        Green
    }   
```
Then in your application code, call GetDescription() on the enum-value:

```csharp
var redDescription = Color.Red.GetDescription();
```


### Performance

To verify the performance claims, run the provided benchmarks in the project "H7P.Enum.BoosterPack.Benchmarks".
The benchmarks are written using BenchmarkDotNet, and require that you compile the benchmark in release-mode and run them from the command line.
This will take some time.
I appreciate any suggestions on how to improve the performance even further, please file an issue with example code.


### Where can I get it?

First, [install NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget). Then, install [Enum Boosterpack](https://www.nuget.org/packages/H7P.Enum.Boosterpack/) from the package manager console:

```
PM> Install-Package H7P.Enum.Boosterpack
```
